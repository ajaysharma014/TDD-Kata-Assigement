# String Calculator

This is a Python implementation of a string calculator that can handle custom delimiters and basic arithmetic operations on integers. It supports both default delimiters (`,` and `\n`) and allows for custom delimiters in the input string.

## Features
- **Supports Default Delimiters**: The calculator uses `,` and `\n` as default delimiters for parsing numbers.
- **Custom Delimiters**: You can define custom delimiters at the start of the string using the format `//[delimiter]\n`.
- **Negative Number Detection**: Negative numbers are not allowed and will raise an error with a detailed message.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs, such as unsupported delimiters or invalid number formats.
- **Supports Multiple Delimiters**: Handles both newlines and commas as delimiters by default or any custom single-character delimiters.
